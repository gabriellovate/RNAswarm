# IAV SPLASH Project Logbook
## 2021.04.12 - Exploring fontionality of vRNAsite
### Context
`vRNAsite` is a software developed by an alumni of the group, Daniel Desir√≤. We are planning on using it to 'annotate' RNA structures in our samples and use those annotations to count SPLASH reads.

## 2021.04.16 - Finish refactoring and regex implementation
Tags: #regex
## Goal
After playing a little with Python's re library, I will finish implementing a regular expression (regex) to get the segment pairs from the np.array's filenames, and refactoring the code according to Kevin's suggestions.
## Useful resources
- [Regular Expression HOWTO](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html)
- [`re` module documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/regex.html#regex-howto)
- 
## Results
The refcatoring of the code is finished, but the `check_heatmaps` is not yet working and has to be fixed.
