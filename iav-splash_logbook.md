# IAV SPLASH Project Logbook
## 2021.04.12 - Exploring fontionality of vRNAsite
### Context
`vRNAsite` is a software developed by an alumni of the group, Daniel Desir√≤. We are planning on using it to 'annotate' RNA structures in our samples and use those annotations to count SPLASH reads.

## 2021.04.16 - Finish refactoring and regex implementation
Tags: #regex
## Goal
After playing a little with Python's re library, I will finish implementing a regular expression (regex) to get the segment pairs from the np.array's filenames, and refactoring the code according to Kevin's suggestions.
## Useful resources
- [Regular Expression HOWTO](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html)
- [`re` module documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/regex.html#regex-howto)
- 
## Results
The refactoring of the code is finished, but the `check_heatmaps` is not yet working and has to be fixed.

## 2021.04.20 - Finish refactoring and regex implementation
### Quick log
The problem was not `check_heatmaps` function, it was just the fact that I was using the wrong filepaths in the file.

## 2021.04.21 - Implement functions to check magnitude of variances
### Goal
- Work on [issue #5](https://github.com/gabriellovate/iav-splash_src/issues/5)

## 2021.04.27 - Test vRNAsite and work on issue #5
### Goal
- Run vRNAsite for genomes provided by Celia
- Work on [issue #5](https://github.com/gabriellovate/iav-splash_src/issues/5)

## 2021.04.29 - Generate visualisations for presentation
### Goals
- Run vRNAsite for genomes provided by Celia
